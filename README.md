# vueGame
Basic initial exploration of Vue.js 2.0 in the form of a game. A player is pitted against a "monster" that can damaged with "attack" and "special attack" actions. For each player action, there is a response by the monster in the form of an attack with a high probablity of dealing more damage than the player. For balance, the player also has "heal" and "give up" actions. 

A log of each Player and Monster action updates after each round.

To play, simply clone the repo and open the HTML file in your browser.
