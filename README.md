# vueGame
Basic initial exploration of Vue.js 2.0 in the form of a game. A player is pitted against a "monster" that he/she can damage with "attack" and "special attack". For each player action, there is a response by the monster in the form of an attack with a high probablity of dealing more damage than the player. In response, the player also has "heal" and "give up" actions.

To play, clone the repo and simply open the HTML file in your browser.
